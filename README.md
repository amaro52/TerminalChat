# TerminalChat
This project will allow two people on separate devices to chat with each other through their terminals. Simply type in [command TBD] to start the program on both terminals and start sending messages!

## How we built it
We built this application using Python. We used WebSockets in Python to be able to send messages back and forth instantly with live updates. 

## Future Plans
The current functionality of this project is very limited. So far, we can send and receive messages with live updates on one computer's terminals. In the future, however, we will improve the project and actually implement the chat between two different terminals on two different computers.
